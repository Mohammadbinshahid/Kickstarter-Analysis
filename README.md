# Analysis of Kickstarter Data
## Overview of Project
Reviewed and analyzed kickstarter data for various kickstarter campaigns comparing impact of goals and start dates on the projects
### Purpose
Helping upcoming playwrite Louise to find out how different crowd funding campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges
Sorting data to requirement to dive deep into relevant data for Theatre & Plays category with respect to launch dates and funding goals
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
1. Maximum successful Outcomes were launched in May
2. Percentage & number of successful campaigns in were highest in May and June
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
1. Highest percentage of successful campaigns were based on a goal less than 1000 (76%)
2. With the funding Target in mind, goal between $5000 and $9999 was 55% successful and is most relevant however campaigns <$5000 & >1000 have a 73% success rate. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* Organizing data properly and sorting out errors using excel formulas was a key challenge however following the steps without skipping made it easy to get the right results
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Maximum successful campaigns were launched in May (67% successful), however June and July are also good months to launch a campaign with success rate at 65% and 63% above the average success rate of 61%
2. Maximum number of campaigns were cancelled in January whereas no campaigns were cancelled in October. Maximum Failed campaigns were launched in December
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Campaigns with goals of less than $1,000 were most successful, campaigns with a goal of $1000 to $4999 were also considerably successful
2. Number of successful campaigns falls considerably to 55% if goal is between $5,000 and $9,999
3. No Campaigns were cancelled
4. 100% of campaigns failed for $45,000 to $49,999 & 75% failed for a goal of $50,000 or more
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Total number of projects for higher campaign goals is very limited
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. We can calculate a table containing mean, mode, median and standard deviation to check for skewness in our data and also to take out outliers using standard deviation or interquartile range.
2. Statistical charts can be created, histogram to find the type of distribution and skew of our data and box and whisker for identifying outliers.
